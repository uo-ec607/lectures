# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes.

- Practical skills that tools that will benefit your dissertation and future career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

Data science skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core 'metrics oeuvre familiar to economists.

- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning; etc.

--

&gt; *"In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was starting out in graduate
school."*

--

P.S. This is an "environmental" PhD seminar only in the most nominal sense. It is really an applied data science course taught by an environmental economist.

# Checklist (cont.)

We will make sure that everything is working properly with your R and GitHub setup next lecture.

For the rest of today's lecture, I want to go over some very basic R concepts.

--

&lt;/br&gt;

PS — Just so you know where we're headed: We'll return to these R concepts (and delve much deeper) next week after a brief, but important detour to the lands of Git(Hub) and the shell.
- Don't worry, it will all make sense. You'll see.

# Why R and RStudio? (cont.)
&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/indeeddotcom-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Why R and RStudio? (cont.)

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

### Bridge to applied economics and other tools

- Already has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.
--

- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

---

# Some R basics

1. Everything is an object.

2. Everything has a name.

3. You do things using functions.

4. Functions come pre-written in packages (i.e. "libraries"), although you can — and should — write your own functions too.

--

&lt;/br&gt;

Points 1. and 2. can be summarised as an [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) approach.
  - This may sound super abstract now, but we'll see *lots* of examples over the coming weeks that will make things clear.

---

# R vs Stata

If you're coming from Stata, some additional things worth emphasizing:

- Multiple objects (e.g. data frames) can exist happily in the same workspace. 
   - No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore` hackery.
   - This is a direct consequence of the OOP approach.

- You will load packages at the start of every new R session. Make peace with this.
  - "Base" R comes with tons of useful in-built functions. It also provides all the tools necessary for you to write your own functions. 
  - However, many of R's best data science functions and tools come from external packages written by other users.

- R easily and infinitely parallelizes. For free.
  - Compare the cost of a [Stata/MP](https://www.stata.com/statamp/) license, nevermind the fact that you effectively pay per core...

- You don't need to `tset or xtset` your data. (Although you can too.)

# Install and load

Open up your laptops. For the remainder of this first lecture, we're going contine playing around with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (i.e. livecoding).

If you don't have them already, install the `ggplot2` and `gapminder` packages via either:
- **Console:** Enter `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gapminder"), dependencies=T)`.
- **RStudio:** Click the "Packages" tab in the bottom-right window pane. Then click "Install" and search for these two packages.
  
![](pics/install.gif)

---

# Install and load (cont.)

Once the packages are installed, load them into your R session with the `library()` function.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) ## Again, we're just using this package for its dataset
```

Notice too that you don't need quotes around the package names any more. Reason: R now recognises these packages as defined objects with given names. ("Everything in R is an object and everything has a name.")

--

PS — A convenient way to combine the package installation and loading steps is with the [pacman package's](https://github.com/trinker/pacman) `p_load()` function. If you run `pacman::p_load(ggplot, gapminder)` it will first look to see whether it needs to install either package before loading them. Clever.
- We'll get to this next week, but if you want to run a function from an (installed) package without loading it, you can use the `PACKAGE::package_function()` syntax.

---

# Brief aside: The gapminder dataset

Because we're going to be plotting the [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) dataset, it is helpful to know that it contains panel data on life expectancy, population size, and GDP per capita for 142 countries since the 1950s.


```r
gapminder
```

# Elements of ggplot2

[Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz/) ggplot2 is one of the most popular packages in the entire R canon. 
- It also happens to be built upon some deep visualization theory: i.e. Leland Wilkinson's [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448).

There's a lot to say about ggplot2's implementation of this "grammar of graphics" approach, but the three key elements are:

1. Your plot ("the visualization") is linked to your variables ("the data") through various **aesthetic mappings**.

2. Once the aesthetic mappings are defined, you can represent your data in different ways by choosing different **geoms** (i.e. "geometric objects" like points, lines or bars).

3. You build your plot in **layers**.

--

&lt;/br&gt;

That's kind of abstract. Let's review each element in turn using our original plot call.

---

# 1. Aesthetic mappings

Here's our earlier ggplot2 code again:


```r
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Focus on the top line, which contains the initialising `ggplot()` function call. This function accepts various arguments, including:
- Where the data come from (i.e. `data = gapminder`).
- What the aesthetic mappings are (i.e. `mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)`).

--

The aesthetic mappings here are pretty simple: They just define an x-axis (GDP per capita) and a y-axis (life expecancy).
- To get a sense of the power and flexibility that comes with this approach, however, consider what happens if we add more aesthetics to the plot call...

---

# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)


```r
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) ## "alpha" controls transparency. Takes a value between 0 and 1.
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/aesthetics2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Note that I've dropped the "mapping =" part of the ggplot call. Most people just start with "aes(...)", since `ggplot2` knows the order of the arguments.

---

# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

Note that we can assign the aesthetic mappings in the geom layer too.

```r
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + ## Applicable to all geoms
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) ## Applicable to this geom only
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/aesthetics3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

Oops. What went wrong here?

```r
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = "big", col="black"), alpha = 0.3)
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/aesthetics_mistake-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**Answer: **Aesthetics must be mapped to variables, not descriptions!

---

# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

At this point, instead of repeating the same ggplot2 call every time, it will prove convenient to define an intermediate plot object that we can re-use.


```r
p = ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/p-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 2. Geoms

Once your variable relationships have been defined by the aesthetic mappings, you can invoke and combine different geoms to generate different visulaizations.


```r
p + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/geoms1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 2. Geoms (cont.)

Aesthetics can be applied differentially across geoms.


```r
p + 
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/geoms2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

The previous plot provides a good illustration of the power (or effect) that comes from assigning aesthetic mappings "globally" vs in the individual geom layers.
- Compare: What happens if you run the below code chunk?


```r
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---

# 2. Geoms (cont.)

Similarly, note that some geoms only accept a subset of mappings. E.g. `geom_density()` doesn't know what to do with the "y" aesthetic mapping.


```r
p + geom_density()
```

```
## Error: geom_density requires the following missing aesthetics: y
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/geoms4-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 2. Geoms (cont.)

We can fix that by being more careful about how we build the plot.


```r
ggplot(data = gapminder) + ## i.e. No "global" aesthetic mappings"
  geom_density(aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent), alpha=0.3)
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/geoms5-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# 3. Build your plot in layers

We've already seen how we can chain (or "layer") consecutive plot elements using the `+` connector.
- The fact that we can create and then re-use an intermediate plot object (e.g. "p") is testament to this.

But it bears repeating: You can build out some truly impressive complexity and transformation of your visualization through this simple layering process.
- Note that you don't have to touch your original data; ggplot2 takes care of all of that.
- For example (see next slide for figure).


```r
p2 =
  p + 
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "Continent", palette = "Set1") + ## Different colour scale
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + ## Switch to logarithmic scale on x-axis. Use dollar units.
  scale_size(name = "Population", labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(x = "Log (GDP per capita)", y = "Life Expectancy") + ## Better axis titles
  theme_bw() ## Try a black and white plot theme
```

---

# 3. Build your plot in layers (cont.)

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/layers2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# What else?

We have barely scratched the surface of ggplot2's functionality... let alone talked about the entire ecosystem of packages that has been built around it. 
- Here's are two quick additional examples to whet your appetite

--

Note that you will need to install and load some additional packages if you want to recreate the next two figures on your own machine. A quick way to do this:


```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
```

```
## Loading required package: pacman
```

```r
pacman::p_load(hrbrthemes, gganimate)
```

---

# What else? (cont.)

Simple extension: Use an external package theme.

```r
# library(hrbrthemes)
p2 + theme_ipsum()
```

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/ipsum_theme-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# What else? (cont.)

Elaborate extension: Animation! (See the next slide for the resulting GIF.)

```r
# library(gganimate)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

---

# What else? (cont.)

&lt;img src="01-Intro_files/figure-html/ggamin2-1.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# What else? (cont.)

There's a lot more to say, but I think we'll stop now for today's lecture.

We also haven't touched on ggplot2's relationship to "tidy" data.
  - It actually forms part of a suite of packages collectively known as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 
  - We will get back to this in Lecture 5.

Rest assured, you will be using ggplot2 throughout the rest of this course and developing your skills along the way.
- Your very first assignment (coming up) is a chance specifically to hone some of those skills.

In the meantime, I want you to do some reading and practice on your own. Pick either of the following (or choose among the litany of online resources) and work through their examples:
- [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) of *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham and Garett Grolemund.
- [Chapter 3](https://socviz.co/makeplot.html#how-ggplot-works) of *Data Visualization: A Practical Guide* by Kieran Healy. (Or just try a chapter at random.)
