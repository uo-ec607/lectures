# Checklist

☑ Have you cloned the course lecture repo to your local machine?

☑ Once that's done, pull to get the latest lecture slides.


Recommended: Spruce up your GitHub profiles. 
- Add your full name, a profile picture, link to website, etc.
- No-one wants to work with (or hire) a barcode.

--

&lt;/br&gt;

Today's lecture is the last detour before we get back to data analyis with R and RStudio.
- Laying proper foundations with Git and the shell will put us in a strong positon for advanced data science work as the course develops.

# The Unix philosophy

The shell tools that we're going to be using today have their roots in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) family of operating systems originally developed at Bells Labs in the 1970s.

Besides paying homage, acknowledging the Unix lineage is important because these tools still embody the "[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)":

&gt; **Do One Thing And Do It Well** 

--

By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.
- You can see why the Unix philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".
  
Again, this philosophy is very clearly expressed in the design and functionality of the Unix shell.

---

# Definitions

Don't be thrown off by terminology: The "shell", "terminal", "tty", "command prompt", etc. 
- These are all basically&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; just different names for the same thing.
- They are all referring to a *command line interface* (CLI).
  
There are many shell variants&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but we're going to focus on [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (i.e. **B**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell).
- Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
- Windows users should have installed it via Git for Windows ([here](https://gitforwindows.org/)), or the new Windows Subsystem for Linux ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target)).


.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [Truth be told](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con), there are some subtle and sometimes important differences, as well as some interesting history behind the names. But we can safely ignore these here.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; For the record, I primarily use the Z shell (zsh) in my day-to-day work, which is why it might look [somewhat different](https://ohmyz.sh/) to yours during live coding sessions.

# Why bother with the shell?

1. Power
  - Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can't do in an IDE or GUI.
  - It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs. We'll get to this issue later in the course.
2. Reproducibility
 - Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.
3. Interacting with servers and super computers
  - The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing. We'll get to this later in the course.
4. Automating workflow and analysis pipelines
  - Easily track and reproduce an entire project (e.g. use a Makefile to combine multiple programs, scripts, etc.)

--

We're going to focus on 1, 2 and 3 in this course. That's not to say that 4 is unimportant (far from it), but we just won't have time to cover it. 
- [Here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm109.nb.html), [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/index.html), and [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) are great places to start learning about automation on your own.

# First look

Open up your Bash shell. 
- [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu) (You already know what you're doing, but still...)
- [Mac](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-terminal-on-a-macbook)
- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/)

You can also access the Bash shell through RStudio, by clicking on the "Terminal" tab of the bottom-left window pane (i.e. next to the "Console" tab).
- This should run Bash by default if it is installed on your system. See [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal) for more details.

---

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~$
```

--

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"
  &lt;!-- - Type in `$ whoami` without the leading dollar sign to confirm. --&gt;

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 `username`@hostname:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username`@hostname`:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname`:~`$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~`$`
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).

- `$` denotes the start of the command prompt.
  - We'll get to this later, but for a special "superuser" called root, the dollar sign will change to a `#`.

---

# Useful keyboard shortcuts

- `Tab` completion.

- Use the `↑` (and `↓`) keys to scroll through previous commands.

- `Ctrl`+`→` (and `Ctrl`+`←`) to skip whole words at a time.

- `Ctrl`+`a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`e` moves the cursor to the end of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`k` deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`u` deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`c` to copy and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` to paste.

- `clear` to clear your terminal.

# Syntax

All Bash commands have the same basic syntax:

**&lt;center&gt;command option(s) argument(s)&lt;/center&gt;**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ ls -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ sort -u myfile.txt
  ```

---
count: false

# Syntax

All Bash commands have the same basic syntax:

**&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style='background: #ffff88;'&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; option(s) argument(s)&lt;/center&gt;**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ `ls` -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ `sort` -u myfile.txt
  ```

---
count: false

# Syntax

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ ls -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ sort -u myfile.txt
  ```

&lt;/br&gt;

**commands**
- You don't always need options or arguments. (E.g. `$ ls ~/Documents/` and `$ ls -lh` are both valid commands that will yield output.)
- However, you always need a command.

---

# Syntax (cont.)

**options** (also called **flags**)
- Start with a dash.
- Usually one letter.
- Multiple options can be chained together under a single dash.
  ```bash
  $ ls -l -a -h /var/log ## This works
  $ ls -lah /var/log ## So does this
  ```
- An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.
  ```bash
  $ ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
  ```

**arguments**
- Tell the command *what* to operate on.
- Usually a file, path, or a set of files and folders.

---

# Help

The `man` command ("manual pages") is your friend if you ever need help.
- Tip: Hit spacebar to scroll down a page at a time, "h" to see the help notes of the `man` command itself and "q" to quit.


```bash
$ man ls
```

##               version (-v), extension (-X)
## 
##        --time=WORD
##               with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time:
##               atime  or  access  or  use  (-u); ctime or status (-c); also use
##               specified time as sort key if --sort=time (newest first)
##

##               first
## 
##        -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order
## 
##        -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text
## 
##        -w, --width=COLS
##               set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit
## 
##        -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns
## 
##        -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension
## 
##        -Z, --context
##               print any security context of each file
## 
##        -1     list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b
## 
##        --help display this help and exit
## 
##        --version
##               output version information and exit
## 
##        The SIZE argument is an integer and  optional  unit  (example:  10K  is
##        10*1024).   Units  are  K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y  (powers  of 1024) or KB,MB,...
##        (powers of 1000).
## 
##        The TIME_STYLE argument can be  full-iso,  long-iso,  iso,  locale,  or
##        +FORMAT.   FORMAT  is  interpreted  like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FOR‐
##        MAT1&lt;newline&gt;FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FOR‐
##        MAT2  to  recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect
##        only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE  environment  vari‐
##        able sets the default style to use.
## 
##        Using  color  to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
##        with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only  when
##        standard  output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
##        variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.
## 
##    Exit status:
##        0      if OK,
## 
##        1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
## 
##        2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

# Help (cont.)

I also like the [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) utility, which provides a more readable summary / cheatsheet of various command. You'll need to install it first. (Linux and MacOS only.)

```
$ cheat ls

## # Displays everything in the target directory
## ls path/to/the/target/directory
## 
## # Displays everything including hidden files
## ls -a
## 
## # Displays all files, along with the size (with unit suffixes) and timestamp
## ls -lh 
## 
## # Display files, sorted by size
## ls -S
## 
## # Display directories only
## ls -d */
## 
## # Display directories only, include hidden
## ls -d .*/ */

# Navigation

- `pwd` to print (the current) working directory.

- `cd` to change directory.

You can use absolute paths, but it's better to use relative paths and invoke special symbols for a user's home folder (`~`), current directory (`.`), and parent directory (`..`) as needed. 


```bash
$ pwd
```

```
## /home/grant/Documents/Teaching/EC607/lectures/03-shell
```


```bash
$ cd examples ## Move into the "examples" sub-directory of this lecture directory.
$ cd ../.. ## Now go back up two directories.
$ pwd
```

# Navigation (cont.)

Beware of directory names that contain spaces. Say you have a directory called "My Documents". (I'm looking at you, Windows.)

- Why won't `$ cd My Documents` work?

--

**Answer:** Bash syntax is super pedantic about spaces and ordering. Here it thinks that "My" and "Documents" are separate arguments.

--

  - Small brain: Use quotation marks: `$ cd "My Documents"`.

  - Big brain: Use Tab completion to automatically "escape" the space: `$ cd My\ Documents`. 
  
  - Galaxy brain: Don't use spaces in file and folder names.

# Listing files and their properties

We're about to go into more depth about the `ls` command.
- To do this effectively, it will be helpful if we're all working off the same group of files and folders.
- Navigate to the directory containing these lecture notes (i.e. `03-shell`). Now list the contents of the  `examples/` sub-directory with the `-lh` option ("long format", "human readable").


```bash
$ # cd PathWhereYouClonedThisRepo/lectures/03-shell ## change as needed
$ ls -lh examples
```

# Create: touch and mkdir

Let's take directories first. To create a directory use `mkdir`:

```bash
$ mkdir testing
```

To create (empty) files, we can use `touch`:

```bash
$ touch testing/test1.txt testing/test2.txt testing/test3.txt
```

Check that it worked

```bash
$ ls testing
```

```
## test1.txt
## test2.txt
## test3.txt
```

---

# Remove: rm and rmdir

Let's delete the objects that we just created. Start with one of the .txt files, by using `rm`.
- We could delete all the files at the same time, but you'll see why I want to keep some.


```bash
$ rm testing/test1.txt
```

The equivalent command for directories is `rmdir`.

```bash
$ rmdir testing
```

```
## rmdir: failed to remove 'testing': Directory not empty
```

--

Uh oh... It won't let us delete the directory while it still has files inside of it. The solution is to use the `rm` command again with the "recursive" (`-r` or `-R`) and "force" (`-f`) options. 
- Excluding the `-f` option is safer, but will trigger a confirmation prompt for every file, which I'd rather avoid here.


```bash
$ rm -rf testing ## Success
```

---

# Copy: cp

The syntax for copying is `$ cp objectname (copyname)`
- If you don't provide a name for the copied object, it will just take the old name.
- However, if there is already an object with the same name in the target destination, then you'll have to use `-f` to force an overwrite.


```bash
$ ## Create new "copies" sub-directory
$ mkdir examples/copies
$ ## Now copy across a file (with a new name)
$ cp examples/reps.txt examples/copies/reps-copy.txt
$ ## Show that we were successful
$ ls examples/copies
```

```
## reps-copy.txt
```

--

You can use `cp` to copy directories, although you'll need the `-r` (or `-R`) flag if you want to recursively copy over everything inside of it to. 
- Try this by copying over the `meals/` sub-directory to `copies/`.

---

# Move and rename: mv 

The syntax for moving is `$ mv object (newobjectname)` 
- Note that moving an object with the "newobjectname" option is a convenient&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; way to rename it.


```bash
$  ## Rename reps-copy to reps2 by moving it with a new name
$ mv examples/copies/reps-copy.txt examples/copies/reps2.txt
$ ls examples/copies
```

```
## reps2.txt
```

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Your convenience mileage may vary.

# Wildcards

[Wildcards](http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) are special characters that can be used as a replacement for other characters. The two most important ones are:

1. Replace any number of characters with `*`. 
 - Convenient when you want to copy, move, or delete a whole class of files.
  
  ```bash
  $ cp examples/*.sh examples/copies ## Copy any file with an .sh extension to "copies"
  $ rm examples/copies/* ## Delete everything in the "copies" directory
  ```

2. Replace a single character with `?`
 - Convenient when you want to discriminate between similarly named files.
  
  ```bash
  $ ls examples/meals/??nday.csv
  $ ls examples/meals/?onday.csv
  ```
  
  ```
  ## examples/meals/monday.csv
  ## examples/meals/sunday.csv
  ## examples/meals/monday.csv
  ```




???

We've already seen one wildcard in the form of the backlash (`\`) that was used to escape spaces in file and folder names, e.g. `$ cd My\ Documents`.

# Motivation

Economists and other (data) scientists spend a lot of time working with text, including scripts, Markdown documents, and delimited text files like CSVs. 

It therefore makes sense to spend a few slides showing off some Bash shell capabilities for working with text files.
- We'll only scratch the surface, but hopefully you'll get an idea of how powerful the shell is in the text domain.

---

# Counting text: wc

You can use the `wc` command to count: 1) lines of text, 2) the number of words, and 3) the number of characters.

Let's demonstrate with a text file containing all of Shakespeare's Sonnets.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


```bash
$ wc examples/sonnets.txt
```

```
##   3029  20701 122780 examples/sonnets.txt
```

]

--

&lt;/br&gt; 

PS — You couldn't tell here, but the character count is actually higher than we'd get if we (bothered) counting by hand, because `wc` counts the invisible newline character "/n".

---

# Reading text

### Read everything: cat

The simplest way to read in text is with the `cat` ("concatenate") command. 
- One problem with large files is that `cat` will read in *all* of the text. You can scroll back up in your shell window, but it can undoubtedly be a pain.

Again, let's demonstrate using Shakespeare's Sonnets. (This will overflow the slide.)
- I'm going to use the `-n` ("number") flag because I want to show line numbers.


```bash
$ cat -n examples/sonnets.txt
```

##     43	
##     44	  I
##     45	
##     46	  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
##     47	  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
##     48	  But as the riper should by time decease,
##     49	  His tender heir might bear his memory:
##     50	  But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
##     51	  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
##     52	  Making a famine where abundance lies,
##     53	  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
##     54	  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
##     55	  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
##     56	  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
##     57	  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
##     58	    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
##     59	    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
##     60	
##     61	  II
##     62	
##     63	  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
##     64	  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
##     65	  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
##     66	  Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
##     67	  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
##     68	  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
##     69	  To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
##     70	  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
##     71	  How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
##     72	  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
##     73	  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
##     74	  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
##     75	    This were to be new made when thou art old,
##     76	    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
##     77	
##     78	  III
##     79	
##     80	  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
##     81	  Now is the time that face should form another;
##     82	  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
##     83	  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
##     84	  For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
##     85	  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
##     86	  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
##     87	  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
##     88	  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
##     89	  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
##     90	  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
##     91	  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
##     92	    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
##     93	    Die single and thine image dies with thee.
##     94	
##     95	  IV
##     96	
##     97	  Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
##     98	  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
##     99	  Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
##    100	  And being frank she lends to those are free:
##    101	  Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
##    102	  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
##    103	  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
##    104	  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
##    105	  For having traffic with thy self alone,
##    106	  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
##    107	  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
##    108	  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
##    109	    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
##    110	    Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
##    111	
##    112	  V
##    113	
##    114	  Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
##    115	  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
##    116	  Will play the tyrants to the very same
##    117	  And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
##    118	  For never-resting time leads summer on
##    119	  To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
##    120	  Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
##    121	  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
##    122	  Then were not summer's distillation left,
##    123	  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
##    124	  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
##    125	  Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
##    126	    But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
##    127	    Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
##    128	
##    129	
##    130	  VI
##    131	
##    132	  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
##    133	  In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
##    134	  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
##    135	  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
##    136	  That use is not forbidden usury,
##    137	  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
##    138	  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
##    139	  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
##    140	  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
##    141	  If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
##    142	  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
##    143	  Leaving thee living in posterity?
##    144	    Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
##    145	    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
##    146	
##    147	  VII
##    148	
##    149	  Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
##    150	  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
##    151	  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
##    152	  Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
##    153	  And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
##    154	  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
##    155	  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
##    156	  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
##    157	  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
##    158	  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
##    159	  The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
##    160	  From his low tract, and look another way:
##    161	    So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
##    162	    Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.
##    163	
##    164	  VIII
##    165	
##    166	  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
##    167	  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
##    168	  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
##    169	  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
##    170	  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
##    171	  By unions married, do offend thine ear,
##    172	  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
##    173	  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
##    174	  Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
##    175	  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
##    176	  Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
##    177	  Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
##    178	    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
##    179	    Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
##    180	
##    181	  IX
##    182	
##    183	  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
##    184	  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
##    185	  Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
##    186	  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
##    187	  The world will be thy widow and still weep
##    188	  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
##    189	  When every private widow well may keep
##    190	  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
##    191	  Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
##    192	  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
##    193	  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
##    194	  And kept unused the user so destroys it.
##    195	    No love toward others in that bosom sits
##    196	    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
##    197	
##    198	  X
##    199	
##    200	  For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
##    201	  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
##    202	  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
##    203	  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
##    204	  For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
##    205	  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
##    206	  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
##    207	  Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
##    208	  O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
##    209	  Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
##    210	  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
##    211	  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
##    212	    Make thee another self for love of me,
##    213	    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
##    214	
##    215	  XI
##    216	
##    217	  As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
##    218	  In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
##    219	  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
##    220	  Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
##    221	  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
##    222	  Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
##    223	  If all were minded so, the times should cease
##    224	  And threescore year would make the world away.
##    225	  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
##    226	  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
##    227	  Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
##    228	  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
##    229	    She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
##    230	    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
##    231	
##    232	  XII
##    233	
##    234	  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
##    235	  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
##    236	  When I behold the violet past prime,
##    237	  And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
##    238	  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
##    239	  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
##    240	  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
##    241	  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
##    242	  Then of thy beauty do I question make,
##    243	  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
##    244	  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
##    245	  And die as fast as they see others grow;
##    246	    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
##    247	    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
##    248	
##    249	  XIII
##    250	
##    251	  O! that you were your self; but, love you are
##    252	  No longer yours, than you your self here live:
##    253	  Against this coming end you should prepare,
##    254	  And your sweet semblance to some other give:
##    255	  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
##    256	  Find no determination; then you were
##    257	  Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
##    258	  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
##    259	  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
##    260	  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
##    261	  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
##    262	  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
##    263	    O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
##    264	    You had a father: let your son say so.
##    265	
##    266	  XIV
##    267	
##    268	  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
##    269	  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
##    270	  But not to tell of good or evil luck,
##    271	  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
##    272	  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
##    273	  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
##    274	  Or say with princes if it shall go well
##    275	  By oft predict that I in heaven find:
##    276	  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
##    277	  And constant stars in them I read such art
##    278	  As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
##    279	  If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
##    280	    Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
##    281	    'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'
##    282	
##    283	  XV
##    284	
##    285	  When I consider every thing that grows
##    286	  Holds in perfection but a little moment,
##    287	  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
##    288	  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
##    289	  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
##    290	  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
##    291	  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
##    292	  And wear their brave state out of memory;
##    293	  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
##    294	  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
##    295	  Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
##    296	  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
##    297	    And all in war with Time for love of you,
##    298	    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
##    299	
##    300	  XVI
##    301	
##    302	  But wherefore do not you a mightier way
##    303	  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
##    304	  And fortify your self in your decay
##    305	  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
##    306	  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
##    307	  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
##    308	  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
##    309	  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
##    310	  So should the lines of life that life repair,
##    311	  Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
##    312	  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
##    313	  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
##    314	    To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
##    315	    And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
##    316	
##    317	  XVII
##    318	
##    319	  Who will believe my verse in time to come,
##    320	  If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
##    321	  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
##    322	  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
##    323	  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
##    324	  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
##    325	  The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
##    326	  Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
##    327	  So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
##    328	  Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
##    329	  And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
##    330	  And stretched metre of an antique song:
##    331	    But were some child of yours alive that time,
##    332	    You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.
##    333	
##    334	  XVIII
##    335	
##    336	  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
##    337	  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
##    338	  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
##    339	  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
##    340	  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
##    341	  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
##    342	  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
##    343	  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
##    344	  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
##    345	  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
##    346	  Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
##    347	  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
##    348	    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
##    349	    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
##    350	
##    351	  XIX
##    352	
##    353	  Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
##    354	  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
##    355	  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
##    356	  And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
##    357	  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
##    358	  And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
##    359	  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
##    360	  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
##    361	  O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
##    362	  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
##    363	  Him in thy course untainted do allow
##    364	  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
##    365	    Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
##    366	    My love shall in my verse ever live young.
##    367	
##    368	  XX
##    369	
##    370	  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
##    371	  Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
##    372	  A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
##    373	  With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
##    374	  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
##    375	  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
##    376	  A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
##    377	  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
##    378	  And for a woman wert thou first created;
##    379	  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
##    380	  And by addition me of thee defeated,
##    381	  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
##    382	    But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
##    383	    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
##    384	
##    385	  XXI
##    386	
##    387	  So is it not with me as with that Muse,
##    388	  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
##    389	  Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
##    390	  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
##    391	  Making a couplement of proud compare.
##    392	  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
##    393	  With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
##    394	  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
##    395	  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
##    396	  And then believe me, my love is as fair
##    397	  As any mother's child, though not so bright
##    398	  As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
##    399	    Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
##    400	    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
##    401	
##    402	  XXII
##    403	
##    404	  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
##    405	  So long as youth and thou are of one date;
##    406	  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
##    407	  Then look I death my days should expiate.
##    408	  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
##    409	  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
##    410	  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
##    411	  How can I then be elder than thou art?
##    412	  O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
##    413	  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
##    414	  Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
##    415	  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
##    416	    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
##    417	    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
##    418	
##    419	  XXIII
##    420	
##    421	  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
##    422	  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
##    423	  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
##    424	  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
##    425	  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
##    426	  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
##    427	  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
##    428	  O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
##    429	  O! let my looks be then the eloquence
##    430	  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
##    431	  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
##    432	  More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
##    433	    O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
##    434	    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
##    435	
##    436	  XXIV
##    437	
##    438	  Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
##    439	  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
##    440	  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
##    441	  And perspective it is best painter's art.
##    442	  For through the painter must you see his skill,
##    443	  To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
##    444	  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
##    445	  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
##    446	  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
##    447	  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
##    448	  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
##    449	  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
##    450	    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
##    451	    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
##    452	
##    453	  XXV
##    454	
##    455	  Let those who are in favour with their stars
##    456	  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
##    457	  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
##    458	  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
##    459	  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
##    460	  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
##    461	  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
##    462	  For at a frown they in their glory die.
##    463	  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
##    464	  After a thousand victories once foil'd,
##    465	  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
##    466	  And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
##    467	    Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
##    468	    Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.
##    469	
##    470	  XXVI
##    471	
##    472	  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
##    473	  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
##    474	  To thee I send this written embassage,
##    475	  To witness duty, not to show my wit:
##    476	  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
##    477	  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
##    478	  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
##    479	  In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
##    480	  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
##    481	  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
##    482	  And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
##    483	  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
##    484	    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
##    485	    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
##    486	
##    487	  XXVII
##    488	
##    489	  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
##    490	  The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
##    491	  But then begins a journey in my head
##    492	  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
##    493	  For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
##    494	  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
##    495	  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
##    496	  Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
##    497	  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
##    498	  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
##    499	  Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
##    500	  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
##    501	    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
##    502	    For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
##    503	
##    504	  XXVIII
##    505	
##    506	  How can I then return in happy plight,
##    507	  That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
##    508	  When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
##    509	  But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
##    510	  And each, though enemies to either's reign,
##    511	  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
##    512	  The one by toil, the other to complain
##    513	  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
##    514	  I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
##    515	  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
##    516	  So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
##    517	  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
##    518	    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
##    519	    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
##    520	
##    521	  XXIX
##    522	
##    523	  When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
##    524	  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
##    525	  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
##    526	  And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
##    527	  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
##    528	  Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
##    529	  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
##    530	  With what I most enjoy contented least;
##    531	  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
##    532	  Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
##    533	  Like to the lark at break of day arising
##    534	  From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
##    535	    For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
##    536	    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
##    537	
##    538	  XXX
##    539	
##    540	  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
##    541	  I summon up remembrance of things past,
##    542	  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
##    543	  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
##    544	  Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
##    545	  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
##    546	  And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
##    547	  And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
##    548	  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
##    549	  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
##    550	  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
##    551	  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
##    552	    But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
##    553	    All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.
##    554	
##    555	  XXXI
##    556	
##    557	  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
##    558	  Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
##    559	  And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
##    560	  And all those friends which I thought buried.
##    561	  How many a holy and obsequious tear
##    562	  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
##    563	  As interest of the dead, which now appear
##    564	  But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
##    565	  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
##    566	  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
##    567	  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
##    568	  That due of many now is thine alone:
##    569	    Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
##    570	    And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.
##    571	
##    572	  XXXII
##    573	
##    574	  If thou survive my well-contented day,
##    575	  When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
##    576	  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
##    577	  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
##    578	  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
##    579	  And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
##    580	  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
##    581	  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
##    582	  O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
##    583	  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
##    584	  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
##    585	  To march in ranks of better equipage:
##    586	    But since he died and poets better prove,
##    587	    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

##    591	  Full many a glorious morning have I seen
##    592	  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
##    593	  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
##    594	  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
##    595	  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
##    596	  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
##    597	  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
##    598	  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
##    599	  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
##    600	  With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
##    601	  But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
##    602	  The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
##    603	    Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
##    604	    Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
##    605	
##    606	  XXXIV
##    607	
##    608	  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
##    609	  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
##    610	  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
##    611	  Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
##    612	  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
##    613	  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
##    614	  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
##    615	  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
##    616	  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
##    617	  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
##    618	  The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
##    619	  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
##    620	    Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
##    621	    And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

##    623	  XXXV
##    624	
##    625	  No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
##    626	  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
##    627	  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
##    628	  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
##    629	  All men make faults, and even I in this,
##    630	  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
##    631	  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
##    632	  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
##    633	  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
##    634	  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
##    635	  And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
##    636	  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
##    637	    That I an accessary needs must be,
##    638	    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

##    643	  Although our undivided loves are one:
##    644	  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
##    645	  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
##    646	  In our two loves there is but one respect,
##    647	  Though in our lives a separable spite,
##    648	  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
##    649	  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
##    650	  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
##    651	  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
##    652	  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,

##    668	  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
##    669	  That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,

##    701	  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
##    702	  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
##    703	  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,

##    731	  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
##    732	  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
##    733	  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
##    734	  Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?

##    738	  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
##    739	    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,

##    746	  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
##    747	  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
##    748	  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
##    749	  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
##    750	  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
##    751	  Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
##    752	  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
##    753	  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
##    754	  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
##    755	  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:

##    765	  Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
##    766	  How would thy shadow's form form happy show
##    767	  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
##    768	  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
##    769	  How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
##    770	  By looking on thee in the living day,
##    771	  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
##    772	  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!

##    782	  No matter then although my foot did stand
##    783	  Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;

##    786	  But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
##    787	  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
##    788	  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
##    789	  I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
##    790	    Receiving nought by elements so slow

##    800	  In tender embassy of love to thee,

##    804	  By those swift messengers return'd from thee,

##    817	  A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
##    818	  But the defendant doth that plea deny,

##    820	  To side this title is impannelled
##    821	  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;

##    833	  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
##    834	  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
##    835	  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
##    836	  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
##    837	  So, either by thy picture or my love,

##    903	  Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
##    904	  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
##    905	  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
##    906	  Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
##    907	  Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
##    908	  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--

##    982	  Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said

##    984	  Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,

##    987	  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
##    988	  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
##    989	  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
##    990	  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
##    991	  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
##    992	  Come daily to the banks, that when they see
##    993	  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
##    994	    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
##    995	    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

##    999	  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
##   1000	  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
##   1001	  I have no precious time at all to spend;

##   1007	  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
##   1008	  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
##   1009	  But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
##   1010	  Save, where you are, how happy you make those.

##   1015	
##   1016	  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,

##   1019	  Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
##   1020	  O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
##   1021	  The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
##   1022	  And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
##   1023	  Without accusing you of injury.
##   1024	  Be where you list, your charter is so strong
##   1025	  That you yourself may privilage your time
##   1026	  To what you will; to you it doth belong

##   1058	  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
##   1059	  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,

##   1072	  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
##   1073	  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
##   1074	  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
##   1075	  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
##   1076	  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
##   1077	  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
##   1078	  To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
##   1079	    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,

##   1084	  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye

##   1086	  And for this sin there is no remedy,
##   1087	  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
##   1088	  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
##   1089	  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
##   1090	  And for myself mine own worth do define,

##   1092	  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
##   1093	  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
##   1094	  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
##   1095	  Self so self-loving were iniquity.

##   1101	  Against my love shall be as I am now,

##   1104	  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
##   1105	  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
##   1106	  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
##   1107	  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
##   1108	  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
##   1109	  For such a time do I now fortify
##   1110	  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
##   1111	  That he shall never cut from memory
##   1112	  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
##   1113	    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,

##   1115	
##   1116	  LXIV
##   1117	
##   1118	  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
##   1119	  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
##   1120	  When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
##   1121	  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
##   1122	  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
##   1123	  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
##   1124	  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
##   1125	  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
##   1126	  When I have seen such interchange of state,
##   1127	  Or state itself confounded, to decay;
##   1128	  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
##   1129	  That Time will come and take my love away.
##   1130	    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
##   1131	    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
##   1132	
##   1133	  LXV
##   1134	
##   1135	  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,

##   1137	  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
##   1138	  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
##   1139	  O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
##   1140	  Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
##   1141	  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
##   1142	  Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
##   1143	  O fearful meditation! where, alack,
##   1144	  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
##   1145	  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
##   1146	  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
##   1147	    O! none, unless this miracle have might,
##   1148	    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

##   1151	
##   1152	  Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
##   1153	  As to behold desert a beggar born,
##   1154	  And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
##   1155	  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
##   1156	  And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
##   1157	  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
##   1158	  And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
##   1159	  And strength by limping sway disabled
##   1160	  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
##   1161	  And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
##   1162	  And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
##   1163	  And captive good attending captain ill:
##   1164	    Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
##   1165	    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
##   1166	
##   1167	  LXVII

##   1171	  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
##   1172	  And lace itself with his society?
##   1173	  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
##   1174	  And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
##   1175	  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
##   1176	  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
##   1177	  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
##   1178	  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
##   1179	  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
##   1180	  And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
##   1181	    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
##   1182	    In days long since, before these last so bad.
##   1183	
##   1184	  LXVIII
##   1185	
##   1186	  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
##   1187	  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
##   1188	  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
##   1189	  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
##   1190	  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
##   1191	  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
##   1192	  To live a second life on second head;
##   1193	  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
##   1194	  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
##   1195	  Without all ornament, itself and true,
##   1196	  Making no summer of another's green,
##   1197	  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
##   1198	    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
##   1199	    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

##   1201	  LXIX
##   1202	
##   1203	  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view

##   1206	  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
##   1207	  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
##   1208	  But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
##   1209	  In other accents do this praise confound
##   1210	  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
##   1211	  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
##   1212	  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
##   1213	  Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
##   1214	  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
##   1215	    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
##   1216	    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
##   1217	
##   1218	  LXX
##   1219	
##   1220	  That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
##   1221	  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
##   1222	  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
##   1223	  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
##   1224	  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
##   1225	  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
##   1226	  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
##   1227	  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
##   1228	  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
##   1229	  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
##   1230	  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
##   1231	  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
##   1232	    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
##   1233	    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

##   1241	  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
##   1242	  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
##   1243	  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,

##   1255	  What merit lived in me, that you should love
##   1256	  After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
##   1257	  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
##   1258	  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
##   1259	  To do more for me than mine own desert,
##   1260	  And hang more praise upon deceased I
##   1261	  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
##   1262	  O! lest your true love may seem false in this
##   1263	  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
##   1264	  My name be buried where my body is,
##   1265	  And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
##   1266	    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,

##   1273	  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
##   1274	  Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
##   1275	  In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
##   1276	  As after sunset fadeth in the west;
##   1277	  Which by and by black night doth take away,
##   1278	  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
##   1279	  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
##   1280	  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
##   1281	  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
##   1282	  Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
##   1283	    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,

##   1287	
##   1288	  But be contented: when that fell arrest
##   1289	  Without all bail shall carry me away,
##   1290	  My life hath in this line some interest,
##   1291	  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
##   1292	  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
##   1293	  The very part was consecrate to thee:
##   1294	  The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
##   1295	  My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
##   1296	  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
##   1297	  The prey of worms, my body being dead;
##   1298	  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
##   1299	  Too base of thee to be remembered.
##   1300	    The worth of that is that which it contains,

##   1303	  LXXV
##   1304	
##   1305	  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,

##   1308	  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
##   1309	  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
##   1310	  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
##   1311	  Now counting best to be with you alone,
##   1312	  Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
##   1313	  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
##   1314	  And by and by clean starved for a look;
##   1315	  Possessing or pursuing no delight,
##   1316	  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
##   1317	    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,

##   1319	
##   1320	  LXXVI
##   1321	
##   1322	  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
##   1323	  So far from variation or quick change?
##   1324	  Why with the time do I not glance aside
##   1325	  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
##   1326	  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
##   1327	  And keep invention in a noted weed,
##   1328	  That every word doth almost tell my name,
##   1329	  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
##   1330	  O! know sweet love I always write of you,
##   1331	  And you and love are still my argument;
##   1332	  So all my best is dressing old words new,
##   1333	  Spending again what is already spent:
##   1334	    For as the sun is daily new and old,

##   1380	  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.

##   1757	  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
##   1758	  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
##   1759	  And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
##   1760	    Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
##   1761	    To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

##   1765	  My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
##   1766	  I love not less, though less the show appear;
##   1767	  That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
##   1768	  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
##   1769	  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
##   1770	  When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
##   1771	  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
##   1772	  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
##   1773	  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
##   1774	  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
##   1775	  But that wild music burthens every bough,
##   1776	  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
##   1777	    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
##   1778	    Because I would not dull you with my song.
##   1779	
##   1780	  CIII
##   1781	
##   1782	  Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
##   1783	  That having such a scope to show her pride,
##   1784	  The argument, all bare, is of more worth
##   1785	  Than when it hath my added praise beside!
##   1786	  O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
##   1787	  Look in your glass, and there appears a face
##   1788	  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
##   1789	  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
##   1790	  Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
##   1791	  To mar the subject that before was well?
##   1792	  For to no other pass my verses tend
##   1793	  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
##   1794	    And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
##   1795	    Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

##   1797	  CIV
##   1798	
##   1799	  To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
##   1800	  For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
##   1801	  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
##   1802	  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
##   1803	  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
##   1804	  In process of the seasons have I seen,
##   1805	  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
##   1806	  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
##   1807	  Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
##   1808	  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
##   1809	  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
##   1810	  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
##   1811	    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
##   1812	    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
##   1813	
##   1814	  CV
##   1815	
##   1816	  Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
##   1817	  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
##   1818	  Since all alike my songs and praises be
##   1819	  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
##   1820	  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
##   1821	  Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
##   1822	  Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
##   1823	  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
##   1824	  'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
##   1825	  'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;
##   1826	  And in this change is my invention spent,
##   1827	  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
##   1828	    Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
##   1829	    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

##   1832	
##   1833	  When in the chronicle of wasted time
##   1834	  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
##   1835	  And beauty making beautiful old rime,
##   1836	  In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
##   1837	  Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
##   1838	  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
##   1839	  I see their antique pen would have express'd
##   1840	  Even such a beauty as you master now.
##   1841	  So all their praises are but prophecies
##   1842	  Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
##   1843	  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
##   1844	  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
##   1845	    For we, which now behold these present days,
##   1846	    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
##   1847	
##   1848	  CVII
##   1849	
##   1850	  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
##   1851	  Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
##   1852	  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
##   1853	  Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
##   1854	  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
##   1855	  And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
##   1856	  Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
##   1857	  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
##   1858	  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
##   1859	  My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
##   1860	  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
##   1861	  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
##   1862	    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
##   1863	    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
##   1864	
##   1865	  CVIII
##   1866	
##   1867	  What's in the brain, that ink may character,
##   1868	  Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
##   1869	  What's new to speak, what now to register,
##   1870	  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
##   1871	  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
##   1872	  I must each day say o'er the very same;
##   1873	  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
##   1874	  Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
##   1875	  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
##   1876	  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
##   1877	  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
##   1878	  But makes antiquity for aye his page;
##   1879	    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
##   1880	    Where time and outward form would show it dead.

##   1882	  CIX
##   1883	
##   1884	  O! never say that I was false of heart,
##   1885	  Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
##   1886	  As easy might I from my self depart
##   1887	  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
##   1888	  That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
##   1889	  Like him that travels, I return again;
##   1890	  Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
##   1891	  So that myself bring water for my stain.
##   1892	  Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
##   1893	  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
##   1894	  That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
##   1895	  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
##   1896	    For nothing this wide universe I call,
##   1897	    Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

##   1899	  CX
##   1900	
##   1901	  Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
##   1902	  And made my self a motley to the view,
##   1903	  Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
##   1904	  Made old offences of affections new;
##   1905	  Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
##   1906	  Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
##   1907	  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
##   1908	  And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
##   1909	  Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
##   1910	  Mine appetite I never more will grind
##   1911	  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
##   1912	  A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
##   1913	    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
##   1914	    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

##   1917	
##   1918	  O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
##   1919	  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
##   1920	  That did not better for my life provide
##   1921	  Than public means which public manners breeds.
##   1922	  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
##   1923	  And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
##   1924	  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
##   1925	  Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
##   1926	  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
##   1927	  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
##   1928	  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
##   1929	  Nor double penance, to correct correction.
##   1930	    Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
##   1931	    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
##   1932	
##   1933	  CXII
##   1934	
##   1935	  Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
##   1936	  Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
##   1937	  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
##   1938	  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
##   1939	  You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
##   1940	  To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
##   1941	  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
##   1942	  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
##   1943	  In so profound abysm I throw all care
##   1944	  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
##   1945	  To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
##   1946	  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
##   1947	    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,

##   1951	
##   1952	  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;

##   1954	  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
##   1955	  Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
##   1956	  For it no form delivers to the heart
##   1957	  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
##   1958	  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
##   1959	  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
##   1960	  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
##   1961	  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
##   1962	  The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
##   1963	  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
##   1964	    Incapable of more, replete with you,

##   1968	
##   1969	  Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
##   1970	  Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
##   1971	  Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
##   1972	  And that your love taught it this alchemy,
##   1973	  To make of monsters and things indigest
##   1974	  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
##   1975	  Creating every bad a perfect best,
##   1976	  As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
##   1977	  O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
##   1978	  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
##   1979	  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
##   1980	  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
##   1981	    If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
##   1982	    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
##   1983	
##   1984	  CXV
##   1985	
##   1986	  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
##   1987	  Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
##   1988	  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
##   1989	  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
##   1990	  But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
##   1991	  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
##   1992	  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
##   1993	  Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
##   1994	  Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
##   1995	  Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
##   1996	  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
##   1997	  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
##   1998	    Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
##   1999	    To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
##   2000	
##   2001	  CXVI
##   2002	
##   2003	  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
##   2004	  Admit impediments. Love is not love
##   2005	  Which alters when it alteration finds,
##   2006	  Or bends with the remover to remove:
##   2007	  O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
##   2008	  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
##   2009	  It is the star to every wandering bark,
##   2010	  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
##   2011	  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
##   2012	  Within his bending sickle's compass come;
##   2013	  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
##   2014	  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
##   2015	    If this be error and upon me prov'd,
##   2016	    I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
##   2017	
##   2018	  CXVII
##   2019	
##   2020	  Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
##   2021	  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
##   2022	  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
##   2023	  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
##   2024	  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
##   2025	  And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
##   2026	  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
##   2027	  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
##   2028	  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
##   2029	  And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
##   2030	  Bring me within the level of your frown,
##   2031	  But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
##   2032	    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
##   2033	    The constancy and virtue of your love.
##   2034	
##   2035	  CXVIII
##   2036	
##   2037	  Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
##   2038	  With eager compounds we our palate urge;
##   2039	  As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
##   2040	  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
##   2041	  Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
##   2042	  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
##   2043	  And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
##   2044	  To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
##   2045	  Thus policy in love, to anticipate
##   2046	  The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
##   2047	  And brought to medicine a healthful state
##   2048	  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
##   2049	    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
##   2050	    Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
##   2051	
##   2052	  CXIX
##   2053	
##   2054	  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
##   2055	  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
##   2056	  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
##   2057	  Still losing when I saw myself to win!
##   2058	  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
##   2059	  Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
##   2060	  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
##   2061	  In the distraction of this madding fever!
##   2062	  O benefit of ill! now I find true
##   2063	  That better is, by evil still made better;
##   2064	  And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
##   2065	  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
##   2066	    So I return rebuk'd to my content,
##   2067	    And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
##   2068

##   2070	
##   2071	  That you were once unkind befriends me now,

##   2073	  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
##   2074	  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
##   2075	  For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
##   2076	  As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
##   2077	  And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
##   2078	  To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
##   2079	  O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
##   2080	  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
##   2081	  And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
##   2082	  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
##   2083	    But that your trespass now becomes a fee;

##   2091	  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
##   2092	  For why should others' false adulterate eyes
##   2093	  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
##   2094	  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
##   2095	  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
##   2096	  No, I am that I am, and they that level
##   2097	  At my abuses reckon up their own:
##   2098	  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
##   2099	  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
##   2100	    Unless this general evil they maintain,

##   2110	  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
##   2111	  Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
##   2112	  Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
##   2113	  That poor retention could not so much hold,

##   2122	  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:

##   2124	  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
##   2125	  They are but dressings of a former sight.
##   2126	  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
##   2127	  What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
##   2128	  And rather make them born to our desire
##   2129	  Than think that we before have heard them told.
##   2130	  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
##   2131	  Not wondering at the present nor the past,
##   2132	  For thy records and what we see doth lie,
##   2133	  Made more or less by thy continual haste.
##   2134	    This I do vow and this shall ever be;

##   2138	
##   2139	  If my dear love were but the child of state,

##   2141	  As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
##   2142	  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
##   2143	  No, it was builded far from accident;
##   2144	  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
##   2145	  Under the blow of thralled discontent,

##   2149	  But all alone stands hugely politic,

##   2158	  Or laid great bases for eternity,
##   2159	  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
##   2160	  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
##   2161	  Lose all and more by paying too much rent
##   2162	  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
##   2163	  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
##   2164	  No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
##   2165	  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
##   2166	  Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
##   2167	  But mutual render, only me for thee.
##   2168	    Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul

##   2175	  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
##   2176	  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
##   2177	  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
##   2178	  As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
##   2179	  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
##   2180	  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
##   2181	  Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
##   2182	  She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
##   2183	    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
##   2184	    And her quietus is to render thee.

##   2188	  In the old age black was not counted fair,

##   2190	  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
##   2191	  And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
##   2192	  For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
##   2193	  Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
##   2194	  Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
##   2195	  But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
##   2196	  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
##   2197	  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
##   2198	  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
##   2199	  Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:

##   2207	  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
##   2208	  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
##   2209	  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
##   2210	  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
##   2211	  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
##   2212	  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
##   2213	  To be so tickled, they would change their state
##   2214	  And situation with those dancing chips,
##   2215	  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
##   2216	  Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
##   2217	    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,

##   2226	  Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
##   2227	  Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
##   2228	  Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,

##   2231	  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
##   2232	  A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;

##   2242	  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
##   2243	  I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
##   2244	  But no such roses see I in her cheeks;

##   2247	  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
##   2248	  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:

##   2537	  Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
##   2538	  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
##   2539	  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
##   2540	  At random from the truth vainly express'd;
##   2541	    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
##   2542	    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
##   2543	
##   2544	  CXLVIII
##   2545	
##   2546	  O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
##   2547	  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
##   2548	  Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
##   2549	  That censures falsely what they see aright?
##   2550	  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
##   2551	  What means the world to say it is not so?
##   2552	  If it be not, then love doth well denote
##   2553	  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
##   2554	  How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
##   2555	  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
##   2556	  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
##   2557	  The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
##   2558	    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
##   2559	    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
##   2560	
##   2561	  CXLIX
##   2562	
##   2563	  Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
##   2564	  When I against myself with thee partake?
##   2565	  Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
##   2566	  Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
##   2567	  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
##   2568	  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
##   2569	  Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
##   2570	  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
##   2571	  What merit do I in my self respect,
##   2572	  That is so proud thy service to despise,
##   2573	  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
##   2574	  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
##   2575	    But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
##   2576	    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
##   2577	
##   2578	  CL
##   2579	
##   2580	  O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
##   2581	  With insufficiency my heart to sway?
##   2582	  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
##   2583	  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
##   2584	  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
##   2585	  That in the very refuse of thy deeds
##   2586	  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
##   2587	  That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
##   2588	  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
##   2589	  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
##   2590	  O! though I love what others do abhor,
##   2591	  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
##   2592	    If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
##   2593	    More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.
##   2594	
##   2595	  CLI
##   2596	
##   2597	  Love is too young to know what conscience is,
##   2598	  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
##   2599	  Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
##   2600	  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
##   2601	  For, thou betraying me, I do betray
##   2602	  My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
##   2603	  My soul doth tell my body that he may
##   2604	  Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
##   2605	  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
##   2606	  As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
##   2607	  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
##   2608	  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
##   2609	    No want of conscience hold it that I call
##   2610	    Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
##   2611	
##   2612	  CLII
##   2613	
##   2614	  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
##   2615	  But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
##   2616	  In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
##   2617	  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
##   2618	  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
##   2619	  When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
##   2620	  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
##   2621	  And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
##   2622	  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
##   2623	  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
##   2624	  And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
##   2625	  Or made them swear against the thing they see;
##   2626	    For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
##   2627	    To swear against the truth so foul a lie!
##   2628

##   2631	  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
##   2632	  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
##   2633	  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
##   2634	  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
##   2635	  Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
##   2636	  A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
##   2637	  And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
##   2638	  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
##   2639	  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
##   2640	  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
##   2641	  I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
##   2642	  And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
##   2643	    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
##   2644	    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

##   2648	  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
##   2649	  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
##   2650	  Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
##   2651	  Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
##   2652	  The fairest votary took up that fire
##   2653	  Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
##   2654	  And so the general of hot desire
##   2655	  Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
##   2656	  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
##   2657	  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
##   2658	  Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
##   2659	  For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
##   2660	    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
##   2661	    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

# Reading text (cont.)

### Scroll: more and less

The `more` and `less` commands provide a bit of additional functionality around `cat`,for example by allowing you to move through long text one page at a time.
- Try this yourself with `$ more examples/sonnets.txt`
- You can move forward and back using the "f" and "b" keys, and quit by hitting "q".

### Preview: head and tail

The `head` and `tail` commands let you limit yourself to a preview of the text, down to a specified number of rows. (The default is 10 rows if you don't specify a number.)


```bash
$ head -n 3 examples/sonnets.txt ## First 3 rows
$ # head examples/sonnets.txt ## First 10 rows (default)
```

```
## ﻿The Project Gutenberg EBook of Shakespeare's Sonnets, by William Shakespeare
## 
## This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
```

---

# Reading text (cont.)

### Preview: head and tail (cont.)

The `tail` works very similarly to `head`, but starting from the bottom. For example, we can see the very last row of a file as follows


```bash
$ tail -n 1 examples/sonnets.txt ## Last row
```

```
## subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
```

However, there's one other neat option that I want to show you. By using the `-n +N` option, we can specify that we want to preview all lines starting from row N *and after*. E.g.


```bash
$ tail -n +3024 examples/sonnets.txt ## Show everything from line 3024
```

```
##      www.gutenberg.org
## 
## This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
## including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
## Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
## subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

# Find patterns: grep

To find patterns in text, we can use regular expression-type matching with `grep`. 

For example, say we want to find the famous opening line to Shakespeare's Sonnet 18.
- I'm going to include the `-n` ("number") flag here, which give me the line that it occurs on. 


```bash
$ grep -n "Shall I compare thee" examples/sonnets.txt
```

```
## 336:  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
```

--

By default, `grep` returns all matching patterns. 
- What happens if you run `$ grep -n "summer" examples/sonnets.txt`?
- Or, for that matter, `$ grep -n "the" examples/sonnets.txt`?

---

# Manipulate text: sed and awk

There are two main commands for manipulating text in the shell, namely `sed` and `awk`.
- Both of these are very powerful and flexible (`awk` is particularly good with CSVs).

I'm going to show two basic examples without going into depth, but I strongly encourage you to explore more on your own.

--

**Example 1.** Replace one text pattern with another.


```bash
$ cat examples/nursery.txt
```

```
## Jack and Jill 
## Went up the hill
```

Now, change "Jack" to "Bill".


```bash
$ sed -i "s/Jack/Bill/g" examples/nursery.txt
$ cat examples/nursery.txt
```

```
## Bill and Jill 
## Went up the hill
```



---

# Manipulate text: sed and awk (cont.)

**Example 2.** Find and count the 10 most commonly used words in Shakespeare's Sonnets.
- Note: We'll learn more about the pipe operator (`|`) in a few slides.


```bash
$ sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' &lt; examples/sonnets.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

```
##    8884 
##     513 the
##     456 of
##     401 to
##     341 my
##     338 in
##     327 I
##     316 and
##     252 thy
##     248 that
```

---

# Sorting and removing duplicates: sort

We can remove duplicate lines in various ways in Bash, but I'll demonstrate using `sort`.


```bash
$ cat examples/reps.txt
```

```
## Sometimes I repeat myself.
## Sometimes I repeat myself.
## Other times not so much.
## But I try to be good.
## Other times not so much.
## Sometimes I repeat myself.
```

There's a fair bit of repetition in this file (and a double entendre). Let's fix that. 
- Note the use of the `-u` ("unique") flag to remove duplicates. I'll also add a `-r` ("reverse") flag, but only because `sort` orders alphabetically and this makes less sense for this simple example.


```bash
$ sort -ur examples/reps.txt
```

```
## Sometimes I repeat myself.
## Other times not so much.
## But I try to be good.
```

# Redirect: &gt;

You can send output from the shell to a file using the redirect operator `&gt;`

For example, let's print a message to the shell using the `echo` command.


```bash
$ echo "At first, I was afraid, I was petrified"
```

```
## At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
```

--

If you wanted to save this output to a file, you need simply redirect it to the filename of choice.


```bash
$ echo "At first, I was afraid, I was petrified" &gt; survive.txt
$ find survive.txt ## Show that it now exists
```

```
## survive.txt
```

---

# Redirect: &gt; (cont.)

If you want to *append* text to an existing file, then you should use `&gt;&gt;`.
- Using `&gt;` will try to overwrite the existing file contents.


```bash
$ echo "'Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side" &gt;&gt; survive.txt
$ cat survive.txt
```

```
## At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
## 'Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
```



--

&lt;/br&gt;

(Don't be shy. You can hum the rest of the song to yourself now.)

--

&lt;/br&gt;

Aside: I often use this sequence when adding files to my .gitignore. E.g. `$ echo "*.csv" &gt;&gt;  .gitignore`.

---

# Pipes: |

The pipe operator `|` is one of the coolest features in Bash.
- It lets you send (i.e. "pipe") intermediate output to another command.
- In other words, it allows us to chain together a sequence of simple operations and thereby implement a more complex operation. (DOTADIW!)

Let me demonstrate using a very simple example.


```bash
$ cat -n examples/sonnets.txt | head -n100 | tail -n10
```

```
##     91	  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
##     92	    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
##     93	    Die single and thine image dies with thee.
##     94	
##     95	  IV
##     96	
##     97	  Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
##     98	  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
##     99	  Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
##    100	  And being frank she lends to those are free:
```

---

# Pipes: | (cont.)

An exercise: Say I want to pull out all of text from (but limited to) Sonnet 18. 
- How might you go about this using the Bash pipe and other commands?
- Tip: Use your knowledge of the starting line (i.e. 336) and the fact that sonnets are 14 lines long.

--


```bash
$ tail -n +336 examples/sonnets.txt | head -n14
```

```
##   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
##   Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
##   Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
##   And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
##   Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
##   And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
##   And every fair from fair sometime declines,
##   By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
##   But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
##   Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
##   Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
##   When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
##     So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
##     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

# Hello World!

Writing code and commands interactively in the shell makes a lot of sense when you are exploring data, file structures, etc.

However, it's also possible (and often desirable) to write reproducible shell scripts that combine a sequence of commands.
- These scripts are demarcated by their `.sh` file extension.

--

Let's look at the contents of a short script that I've included in the examples folder.


```bash
$ cat examples/hello.sh
```

```
## #!/bin/sh
## echo -e "\nHello World!\n"
```

--

I'm sure that you already have a good idea of what this script is meant to do, but it will prove useful to quickly go through some things together.

---

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
*#!/bin/sh
echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)

---
count: false

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
*echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)
- `echo -e "\nHello World!\n"` is the actual command that we want to run.

---
count: false

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)
- `echo -e "\nHello World!\n"` is the actual command that we want to run.

To run this simple script, you can just type in the file name and press enter.


```bash
$ examples/hello.sh
$ # bash examples/hello.sh ## Also works

```

```
## 
## Hello World!
```

# Editing and writing with nano

Say you want to edit my (amazing) script. 
- Maybe you want to add some additional lines of text, or maybe you're bothered by the fact that there should be a comma after "Hello". (It's a salutation, dammit!) 

We already seen how to append text lines to a file, but when it comes to larger jobs or more complicated editing work, you're better off using [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/). 
- In-built Unix shell text editor. (**Windows users**, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36802996/bash-nano-command-not-found-at-windows-git-bash).)

Open up the script in nano by typing `$ nano examples/hello.sh`. 
- Note that the functionality is more limited than a normal text editor.
- Once you are finished editing, hit "Ctrl+X", then "y" and enter to exit.
- Finally, run the edited version of the script.

--

If you've been having trouble executing this script (or want to limit who else can execute it), then you need to alter its permissions. Which takes us neatly on to our final section...

# Disclaimer

*This next section is tailored towards Unix-based operating systems, like Linux or MacOS, which is why I have saved it for the end. &lt;b&gt;Windows users:&lt;/b&gt; Don't be suprised if some commands don't work for you.* 

*Regardless, the things we learn here will become relevant to everyone (even Windows users) once we start interacting with Linux servers, spinning up Docker containers, etc. later in the course.*

---

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc.

There are two main user roles on a Linux system:   
1. Normal users 
2. A superuser (AKA "root")

Difference is one of priviledge. 
- Superusers can make system changes, install software, browse through different users' home folders, etc. Normal users are much more restricted in what they can do.
- Explains why Unix-based OS's are much more resilient to security threats like viruses. Need superuser priviledges to install (potentially malicious) software.

---

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc. (cont.)

You *can* log in as the superuser&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;... but this is generally considered very poor practice, since you needlessly risk messing up your system. 
- There are no safety checks and no "undo" options.

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hit "p" on this slide if you really want to know how.
]

???
To switch over to the superuser, you can type `sudo -s`.
- Note the extra visual cue: root's command prompt is a `#` (not a `$`).
  ```
  root@laptop:~#
  ```

Remember to type `exit` to switch back!

(Close these presenter notes by hitting "p" again.)

--

**Question:** How, then, can normal users perform meaningful system operations (including installing new programs and updating software)?

--

**Answer:** Invoke temporary superuser status with `sudo`.

- Stands for "superuser do".
- Simply prepend `sudo` to whatever command you want to run.

```bash
grant@laptop:~$ ls /root ## fails
grant@laptop:~$ sudo ls /root ## works
```

???

Note that you have to be a "permitted" user to invoke `sudo`. 
- This should be enabled by default on your personal laptop, but if not see [here](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/sudo-command-examples/embed/) or [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-quickstart).

# Changing permissions and ownership

Let's think back to the `ABC/` directory that we saw previously while exploring the ls command.

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 grant users 4.0K Jan 12 22:12  ABC
```

We can change the permissions and ownership of this folder with the `chmod` and `chown` commands, respectively. We'll now review these in turn.
- Note that I'm going to use the "recursive" option (i.e. `-R`) in the examples that follow, but only because `ABC/` is a directory. You can drop that when modifying individual files.

--

PS — I'm going to skip writing out the full path for this next section to save on typing. Now is a a good time to move into the `examples/` directory if you want to follow along with my commands literally.


```bash
$ cd examples
```

---

# chmod

Changing permissions using `chmod` depends on how those permissions are represented. 

There are two options: 1) Octal notation and 2) Symbolic notation. 
- We'll go into more detail on the next slide, but let's see some examples first.
- (Test the results yourself using the `ls -lh` command afterwards.)

--

**Example 1: rwxrwxrwx.** Read, write and execute permission for all users.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 777 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R a=rwx ABC`

--

**Example 2: rwxr-xr-x.** Read, write and execute permission for the main user (i.e. owner) of the file. For all other users, read and execute permission only.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 755 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx ABC`

--

Now that we've seen some examples, let's get into the logic behind them.

---

# chmod (cont.)

### Octal notation

Takes advantage of the fact that `4` (for "read"), `2` (for "write"), and `1` (for "execute") can be combined in unambiguous ways.
- 7 (= 4 + 2 + 1) means read, write and execute permission.
- 5 (= 4 + 0 + 1) means read and execute permission, but not write permission.
- etc. 
- Note that Octal notation requires a number for each of the three user types: owner, owner's group, and all others. E.g. `$ chmod 777 myfile.txt`

### Symbolic notation

Links permissions to different symbols (i.e. abbreviations).
- Users: `u` ("User/owner"), `g` ("Group"), `o` ("Others""), `a` ("All")
- Permissions: `r` ("read"), `w` ("write"), `x` ("execute")
- Changes: `+` ("add permissions"), `-` ("remove permissions"), `=` ("set new permissions") 

---

# chmod (cont.)

Here's a quick comparison table with some common permission levels.

| Octal value | Symbolic value    | Permission level |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| 777         | a+rwx             | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 770         | u+rwx,g+rwx,o-rwx | rwxrwx---        |
| 755         | a+rwx,g=rw,o=rw   | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 700         | u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx | rwx------        |
| 644         | u=rw,g=r,o=r      | rw-r--r--        |


--

&lt;/br&gt; 

PS — Note the Symbolic method allows for relative changes, which means that you don't necessarily need to write out the whole entry in the table above. E.g. To go from the first line to the second line, you'd only need `$ chmod o-rwx myfile`.

---

# chown

Changing file ownership is somewhat easier than changing permissions, because you don't have to remember the different Octal and Symbolic notation mappings. 
- E.g. Say there is another user on your computer called "alice", then you could just assign her ownership of the ABC subfolder using:
 ```bash
 $ chown -R alice ABC
 ```

Things get a little more interesting when we want to add new users and groups, or change an existing users group.
- I'll save that for a later lecture on cloud servers, though.

# Things we didn't cover today

I know we covered a lot of ground today and I hope that I've given you a sense of how Bash works and how useful it can be.
- My main goal is to help "demystify" it, so that you aren't intimidated when you need to use shell commands later on.

At the same time, there's a lot that we didn't cover today.
- For loops, variables and functions, SSH, memory management (e.g. [top](https://ss64.com/bash/top.html) and [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/)), etc.
- We'll get to some of these topics in the later lectures, but please try to work some of the suggested exercises on the next slide and make use of the recommended readings.

# Next steps

### Exercises

Navigate to the `examples/` sub-directory associated with this lecture. I want you to try and play around with the contents using some of the different Bash commands we've practiced today.
- Change the permissions on an indivdual file or a whole directory.
- Read in (or fix) some lines of text from one file and pipe them to another file.
- Count the number of times Shakespeare refers to "mistress" or "love" in his Sonnets.
- Merge the separate CSVs in the "meals" subfolder into one document.
- Write a new bash script and execute it.
- Etc.
