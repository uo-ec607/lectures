# Checklist

☑ Have you cloned the course lecture repo to your local machine?

☑ Once that's done, pull to get the latest lecture slides.


Recommended: Spruce up your GitHub profiles. 
- Add your full name, a profile picture, link to website, etc.
- No-one wants to work with (or hire) a barcode.

--

</br>

Today's lecture is the last detour before we get back to data analyis with R and RStudio.
- Laying proper foundations with Git and the shell will put us in a strong positon for advanced data science work as the course develops.

# The Unix philosophy

The shell tools that we're going to be using today have their roots in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) family of operating systems originally developed at Bells Labs in the 1970s.

Besides paying homage, acknowledging the Unix lineage is important because these tools still embody the "[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)":

> **Do One Thing And Do It Well** 

--

By pairing and chaining well-designed individual components, we can build powerful and much more complex larger systems.
- You can see why the Unix philosophy is also referred to as "minimalist and modular".
  
Again, this philosophy is very clearly expressed in the design and functionality of the Unix shell.

---

# Definitions

Don't be thrown off by terminology: *shell*, *terminal*, *tty*, *command prompt*, etc. 
- These are all basically just different names for the same thing.<sup>1</sup>
- They are all referring to a **command line interface** (CLI).

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> [Truth be told](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con), there are some subtle and sometimes important differences, as well as some interesting history behind the names. But we can safely ignore these here.
]

--

There are many shell variants, but we're going to focus on [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (i.e. **B**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell).
- Default shell on Linux and MacOS.
- Windows users should have installed it via Git for Windows ([here](https://gitforwindows.org/)), or the new Windows Subsystem for Linux ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target)).

--

</br>

(For the record, I primarily use [Zsh (i.e. Z shell)](https://ohmyz.sh/), which is why my shell might look slightly different to yours during live coding sessions. The commands will stay the same, though.)


---

# Why bother with the shell?

1. Power
  - Both for executing commands and for fixing problems. There are some things you just can't do in an IDE or GUI.
  - It also avoids memory complications associated with certain applications and/or IDEs. We'll get to this issue later in the course.
2. Reproducibility
 - Scripting is reproducible, while clicking is not.
3. Interacting with servers and super computers
  - The shell is often the only game in town for high performance computing. We'll get to this later in the course.
4. Automating workflow and analysis pipelines
  - Easily track and reproduce an entire project (e.g. use a Makefile to combine multiple programs, scripts, etc.)

--

We're going to focus on 1, 2 and 3 in this course. That's not to say that 4 is unimportant (far from it), but we just won't have time to cover it. 
- [Here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm109.nb.html), [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/index.html), and [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) are great places to start learning about automation on your own.

# First look

Open up your Bash shell. 
- [Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu) (You already know what you're doing, but still...)
- [Mac](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-terminal-on-a-macbook)
- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/)

You can also access the Bash shell through RStudio.
- Hitting `Shift`+`Alt`+`T` will cause a "Terminal" tab to open up in the bottom-left window pane (i.e. next to the "Console" tab).
- Again, this should run Bash by default if it is installed on your system. See [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal) for more details.

---

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~$
```

--

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"
  <!-- - Type in `$ whoami` without the leading dollar sign to confirm. -->

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 `username`@hostname:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username`@hostname`:~$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname`:~`$ 
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).


---
count: false

# First look (cont.)

You should see something like:

```bash
 username@hostname:~`$`
```

This is shell-speak for: "Who am I and where am I?"

- `username` denotes a specific user (one of potentially many on this computer). 

- `@hostname` denotes the name of the computer or server.

- `:~` denotes the directory path (where `~` signifies the user's home directory).

- `$` denotes the start of the command prompt.
  - We'll get to this later, but for a special "superuser" called root, the dollar sign will change to a `#`.

---

# Useful keyboard shortcuts

- `Tab` completion.

- Use the `↑` (and `↓`) keys to scroll through previous commands.

- `Ctrl`+`→` (and `Ctrl`+`←`) to skip whole words at a time.

- `Ctrl`+`a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`e` moves the cursor to the end of the line.

- `Ctrl`+`k` deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`u` deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`c` to copy and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` to paste.

- `clear` to clear your terminal.

# Syntax

All Bash commands have the same basic syntax:

**<center>command option(s) argument(s)</center>**

Examples:

  ```bash
  $ ls -lh ~/Documents/
  ```
  ```bash
  $ sort -u myfile.txt
  ```

---

Examples:

  ```bash

  ```

</br>

**commands**
- You don't always need options or arguments. (E.g. `$ ls ~/Documents/` and `$ ls -lh` are both valid commands that will yield output.)
- However, you always need a command.

---

# Syntax (cont.)

**options** (also called **flags**)
- Start with a dash.
- Usually one letter.
- Multiple options can be chained together under a single dash.
  ```bash
  $ ls -l -a -h /var/log ## This works
  $ ls -lah /var/log ## So does this
  ```
- An exception is with (rarer) options requiring two dashes.
  ```bash
  $ ls --group-directories-first --human-readable /var/log
  ```

**arguments**
- Tell the command *what* to operate on.
- Usually a file, path, or a set of files and folders.

---

# Help

The `man` command ("manual pages") is your friend if you ever need help.
- Tip: Hit spacebar to scroll down a page at a time, "h" to see the help notes of the `man` command itself and "q" to quit.

```{bash man}
man ls
```

---

# Help (cont.)

I also like the [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) utility, which provides a more readable summary / cheatsheet of various command. You'll need to install it first. (Linux and MacOS only.)

```
$ cheat ls

## # Displays everything in the target directory
## ls path/to/the/target/directory
## 
## # Displays everything including hidden files
## ls -a
## 
## # Displays all files, along with the size (with unit suffixes) and timestamp
## ls -lh 
## 
## # Display files, sorted by size
## ls -S
## 
## # Display directories only
## ls -d */
## 
## # Display directories only, include hidden
## ls -d .*/ */

# Navigation

Key navigation commands:

- `pwd` to print (the current) working directory.

- `cd` to change directory.

```{bash nav1}
pwd
```

--

You can use absolute paths, but it's better to use relative paths and invoke special symbols for a user's home folder (`~`), current directory (`.`), and parent directory (`..`) as needed. 

```{bash nav2}
cd examples ## Move into the "examples" sub-directory of this lecture directory.
cd ../.. ## Now go back up two directories.
pwd
```

---

# Navigation (cont.)

Beware of directory names that contain spaces. Say you have a directory called "My Documents". (I'm looking at you, Windows.)

- Why won't `$ cd My Documents` work?

--

**Answer:** Bash syntax is super pedantic about spaces and ordering. Here it thinks that "My" and "Documents" are separate arguments.

--

  - Small brain: Use quotation marks: `$ cd "My Documents"`.

  - Big brain: Use Tab completion to automatically "escape" the space: `$ cd My\ Documents`. 
  
  - Galaxy brain: Don't use spaces in file and folder names.

# Listing files and their properties

We're about to go into more depth about the `ls` command.
- To do this effectively, it will be helpful if we're all working off the same group of files and folders.
- Navigate to the directory containing these lecture notes (i.e. `03-shell`). Now list the contents of the  `examples/` sub-directory with the `-lh` option ("long format", "human readable").

```{bash ls}
# cd PathWhereYouClonedThisRepo/lectures/03-shell ## change as needed
ls -lh examples
```

Note: We'll return to file permissions and ownership at the end of the lecture.

---

# Create: touch and mkdir

One of the most common shell tasks is object creation (files, directories, etc.)

We use `mkdir` to create directories. E.g. To create a new "testing" directory:
```{bash mkdir}
mkdir testing
```

We use `touch` to create (empty) files. E.g. To add some files to our new directory:
```{bash touch}
touch testing/test1.txt testing/test2.txt testing/test3.txt
```

--

Check that it worked:
```{bash}
ls testing
```

---

# Remove: rm and rmdir

Let's delete the objects that we just created. Start with one of the .txt files, by using `rm`.
- We could delete all the files at the same time, but you'll see why I want to keep some.

```{bash rm1}
rm testing/test1.txt
```

The equivalent command for directories is `rmdir`.
```{bash rmdir, error=T}
rmdir testing
```

--

Uh oh... It won't let us delete the directory while it still has files inside of it. The solution is to use the `rm` command again with the "recursive" (`-r` or `-R`) and "force" (`-f`) options. 
- Excluding the `-f` option is safer, but will trigger a confirmation prompt for every file, which I'd rather avoid here.

```{bash rm2, error=T}
rm -rf testing ## Success
```

---

# Copy: cp

The syntax for copying is `$ cp objectname (copyname)`
- If you don't provide a name for the copied object, it will just take the old name.
- However, if there is already an object with the same name in the target destination, then you'll have to use `-f` to force an overwrite.

```{bash cp}
## Create new "copies" sub-directory
mkdir examples/copies
## Now copy across a file (with a new name)
cp examples/reps.txt examples/copies/reps-copy.txt
## Show that we were successful
ls examples/copies
```

--

You can use `cp` to copy directories, although you'll need the `-r` (or `-R`) flag if you want to recursively copy over everything inside of it to. 
- Try this by copying over the `meals/` sub-directory to `copies/`.

---

# Move and rename: mv 

The syntax for moving is `$ mv object (newobjectname)` 
- Note that moving an object with the "newobjectname" option is a convenient<sup>1</sup> way to rename it.

```{bash mv}
 ## Rename reps-copy to reps2 by moving it with a new name
mv examples/copies/reps-copy.txt examples/copies/reps2.txt
ls examples/copies
```

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Your convenience mileage may vary.
]

---

# Wildcards

[Wildcards](http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) are special characters that can be used as a replacement for other characters. The two most important ones are:

1. Replace any number of characters with `*`. 
 - Convenient when you want to copy, move, or delete a whole class of files.
  ```{bash asterisk}
  cp examples/*.sh examples/copies ## Copy any file with an .sh extension to "copies"
  rm examples/copies/* ## Delete everything in the "copies" directory
  ```

2. Replace a single character with `?`
 - Convenient when you want to discriminate between similarly named files.
  ```{bash qmark}
  ls examples/meals/??nday.csv
  ls examples/meals/?onday.csv
  ```  

```{bash, echo = F}
## Remove "copies" sub-dir to avoid "file alredy exists" problem when re-knitting this doc
rm -rf examples/copies
```


???

We've already seen one wildcard in the form of the backlash (`\`) that was used to escape spaces in file and folder names, e.g. `$ cd My\ Documents`.

---

# Motivation

Economists and other (data) scientists spend a lot of time working with text, including scripts, Markdown documents, and delimited text files like CSVs. 

It therefore makes sense to spend a few slides showing off some Bash shell capabilities for working with text files.
- We'll only scratch the surface, but hopefully you'll get an idea of how powerful the shell is in the text domain.

---

# Counting text: wc

You can use the `wc` command to count: 1) lines of text, 2) the number of words, and 3) the number of characters.

Let's demonstrate with a text file containing all of Shakespeare's Sonnets.<sup>1</sup>

```{bash wc}
wc examples/sonnets.txt
```

.footnote[

]

--

</br> 

PS — You couldn't tell here, but the character count is actually higher than we'd get if we (bothered) counting by hand, because `wc` counts the invisible newline character "/n".

---

# Reading text

### Read everything: cat

The simplest way to read in text is with the `cat` ("concatenate") command. Note that `cat` will read in *all* of the text. You can scroll back up in your shell window, but this can still be a pain.

Again, let's demonstrate using Shakespeare's Sonnets. (This will overflow the slide.)
- I'm going to use the `-n` ("number") flag because I want to show line numbers.

--

```{bash cat}
cat -n examples/sonnets.txt
```

---

# Reading text (cont.)

### Scroll: more and less

The `more` and `less` commands provide extra functionality over `cat`. For example, they allow you to move through long text one page at a time.
- Try this yourself with `$ more examples/sonnets.txt`
- You can move forward and back using the "f" and "b" keys, and quit by hitting "q".

### Preview: head and tail

The `head` and `tail` commands let you limit yourself to a preview of the text, down to a specified number of rows. (The default is 10 rows if you don't specify a number.)

```{bash head}
head -n 3 examples/sonnets.txt ## First 3 rows
# head examples/sonnets.txt ## First 10 rows (default)
```

---

# Reading text (cont.)

### Preview: head and tail (cont.)

The `tail` works very similarly to `head`, but starting from the bottom. For example, we can see the very last row of a file as follows

```{bash tail1}
tail -n 1 examples/sonnets.txt ## Last row
```

--

However, there's one other neat option that I want to show you. By using the `-n +N` option, we can specify that we want to preview all lines starting from row N *and after*. E.g.

```{bash tail2}
tail -n +3024 examples/sonnets.txt ## Show everything from line 3024
```

---

# Find patterns: grep

To find patterns in text, we can use regular expression-type matching with `grep`. 

For example, say we want to find the famous opening line to Shakespeare's [Sonnet 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_18).
- I'm going to include the `-n` ("number") flag to get the line that it occurs on. 

```{bash grep}
grep -n "Shall I compare thee" examples/sonnets.txt
```

--

By default, `grep` returns all matching patterns. 
- What happens if you run `$ grep -n "summer" examples/sonnets.txt`?
- Or, for that matter, `$ grep -n "the" examples/sonnets.txt`?

---

# Manipulate text: sed and awk

There are two main commands for manipulating text in the shell, namely `sed` and `awk`.
- Both of these are very powerful and flexible (`awk` is particularly good with CSVs).

I'm going to show two basic examples without going into depth, but I strongly encourage you to explore more on your own.

--

**Example 1.** Replace one text pattern with another.

```{bash nursery}
cat examples/nursery.txt
```

Now, change "Jack" to "Bill".

```{bash sed1a}
sed -i "s/Jack/Bill/g" examples/nursery.txt
cat examples/nursery.txt
```

```{bash, echo=F}
## Change it back for when we want to re-knit the file.
sed -i "s/Bill/Jack/g" examples/nursery.txt
```

---

# Manipulate text: sed and awk (cont.)

**Example 2.** Find and count the 10 most commonly used words in Shakespeare's Sonnets.
- Note: We'll learn more about the pipe operator (`|`) in a few slides.

```{bash sed2}
sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < examples/sonnets.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

---

# Sorting and removing duplicates: sort

We can remove duplicate lines in various ways in Bash, but I'll demonstrate using `sort`.

```{bash reps}
cat examples/reps.txt
```

There's a fair bit of repetition in this file (and a double entendre). Let's fix that. 
- Note the use of the `-u` ("unique") flag to remove duplicates. I'll also add a `-r` ("reverse") flag, but only because `sort` orders alphabetically and this makes less sense for this simple example.

```{bash sort}
sort -ur examples/reps.txt
```

---

# Redirect: >

You can send output from the shell to a file using the redirect operator `>`

For example, let's print a message to the shell using the `echo` command.

```{bash}
echo "At first, I was afraid, I was petrified"
```

--

If you wanted to save this output to a file, you need simply redirect it to the filename of choice.

```{bash}
echo "At first, I was afraid, I was petrified" > survive.txt
find survive.txt ## Show that it now exists
```

---

# Redirect: > (cont.)

If you want to *append* text to an existing file, then you should use `>>`.
- Using `>` will try to overwrite the existing file contents.

```{bash}
echo "'Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side" >> survive.txt
cat survive.txt
```

```{bash, echo = F}
## Remove file so that we do't keep adding to it when we re-knit these slides
rm survive.txt
```

--

</br>

(Don't be shy. You can hum the rest of the song to yourself now.)

--

Aside: I often use this sequence when adding files to my .gitignore. E.g. `$ echo "*.csv" >>  .gitignore`.

---

# Pipes: |

The pipe operator `|` is one of the coolest features in Bash.
- It lets you send (i.e. "pipe") intermediate output to another command.
- In other words, it allows us to chain together a sequence of simple operations and thereby implement a more complex operation. (Remember the Unix philosophy!)

Let me demonstrate using a very simple example.

```{bash pipe1}
cat -n examples/sonnets.txt | head -n100 | tail -n10
```

---

# Pipes: | (cont.)

An exercise: Say I want to pull out all of text from (but limited to) Sonnet 18. 
- How might you go about this using the Bash pipe and other commands?
- Tip: Use your knowledge of the starting line (i.e. 336) and the fact that sonnets are 14 lines long.

--

```{bash pipe2}
tail -n +336 examples/sonnets.txt | head -n14
```

# Hello World!

Writing code and commands interactively in the shell makes a lot of sense when you are exploring data, file structures, etc.

However, it's also possible (and often desirable) to write reproducible shell scripts that combine a sequence of commands.
- These scripts are demarcated by their `.sh` file extension.

--

Let's look at the contents of a short script that I've included in the examples folder.

```{bash hello}
cat examples/hello.sh
```

--

I'm sure that you already have a good idea of what this script is meant to do, but it will prove useful to quickly go through some things together.

---

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
*#!/bin/sh
echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)

---
count: false

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
*echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)
- `echo -e "\nHello World!\n"` is the actual command that we want to run.

---
count: false

# Hello World! (cont.)

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo -e "\nHello World!\n"

```

- `#!/bin/sh` is a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix), indicating which program to run the command with (here: any Bash-compatible shell). However, it is typically ignored (note that it begins with the hash comment character.)
- `echo -e "\nHello World!\n"` is the actual command that we want to run.

To run this simple script, you can just type in the file name and press enter.

```{bash hello_run}
examples/hello.sh
# bash examples/hello.sh ## Also works

```

---

# Editing and writing with nano

Say you want to edit my (amazing) script. 
- Maybe you want to add some additional lines of text, or maybe you're bothered by the fact that there should be a comma after "Hello". (It's a salutation, dammit!) 

We already seen how to append text lines to a file, but when it comes to larger jobs or more complicated editing work, you're better off using [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/). 
- In-built Unix shell text editor. (**Windows users**, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36802996/bash-nano-command-not-found-at-windows-git-bash).)

Open up the script in nano by typing `$ nano examples/hello.sh`. 
- Note that the functionality is more limited than a normal text editor.
- Once you are finished editing, hit "Ctrl+X", then "y" and enter to exit.
- Finally, run the edited version of the script.

--

If you've been having trouble executing this script (or want to limit who else can execute it), then you need to alter its permissions. Which takes us neatly on to our final section...

# Disclaimer

*This next section is tailored towards Unix-based operating systems, like Linux or MacOS, which is why I have saved it for the end. <b>Windows users:</b> Don't be suprised if some commands don't work for you.* 

*Regardless, the things we learn here will become relevant to everyone (even Windows users) once we start interacting with Linux servers, spinning up Docker containers, etc. later in the course.*

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc.

There are two main user roles on a Linux system:   
1. Normal users 
2. A superuser (AKA "root")

Difference is one of priviledge. 
- Superusers can make system changes, install software, browse through different users' home folders, etc. Normal users are much more restricted in what they can do.
- Explains why Unix-based OS's are much more resilient to security threats like viruses. Need superuser priviledges to install (potentially malicious) software.

---

# The superuser: root, sudo, etc. (cont.)

You *can* log in as the superuser<sup>1</sup>... but this is generally considered very poor practice, since you needlessly risk messing up your system. 
- There are no safety checks and no "undo" options.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Hit "p" on this slide if you really want to know how.
]

???
To switch over to the superuser, you can type `sudo -s`.
- Note the extra visual cue: root's command prompt is a `#` (not a `$`).
  ```
  root@laptop:~#
  ```

Remember to type `exit` to switch back!

(Close these presenter notes by hitting "p" again.)

--

**Question:** How, then, can normal users perform meaningful system operations (including installing new programs and updating software)?

--

**Answer:** Invoke temporary superuser status with `sudo`.

- Stands for "superuser do".
- Simply prepend `sudo` to whatever command you want to run.

```bash
grant@laptop:~$ ls /root ## fails
grant@laptop:~$ sudo ls /root ## works
```

???

Note that you have to be a "permitted" user to invoke `sudo`. 
- This should be enabled by default on your personal laptop, but if not see [here](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/sudo-command-examples/embed/) or [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-quickstart).

# Changing permissions and ownership

Let's think back to the `ABC/` directory that we saw previously while exploring the ls command.

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 grant users 4.0K Jan 12 22:12  ABC
```

We can change the permissions and ownership of this folder with the `chmod` and `chown` commands, respectively. We'll now review these in turn.
- Note that I'm going to use the "recursive" option (i.e. `-R`) in the examples that follow, but only because `ABC/` is a directory. You can drop that when modifying individual files.

--

PS — I'm going to skip writing out the full path for this next section to save on typing. Now is a a good time to move into the `examples/` directory if you want to follow along with my commands literally.

```{bash, eval = F}
cd examples
```

---

# chmod

Changing permissions using `chmod` depends on how those permissions are represented. 

There are two options: 1) Octal notation and 2) Symbolic notation. 
- We'll go into more detail on the next slide, but let's see some examples first.
- (Test the results yourself using the `ls -lh` command afterwards.)

--

**Example 1: rwxrwxrwx.** Read, write and execute permission for all users.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 777 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R a=rwx ABC`

--

**Example 2: rwxr-xr-x.** Read, write and execute permission for the main user (i.e. owner) of the file. For all other users, read and execute permission only.
- Octal: `$ chmod -R 755 ABC`
- Symbolic: `$ chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx ABC`

--

Now that we've seen some examples, let's get into the logic behind them.

---

# chmod (cont.)

### Octal notation

Takes advantage of the fact that `4` (for "read"), `2` (for "write"), and `1` (for "execute") can be combined in unambiguous ways.
- 7 (= 4 + 2 + 1) means read, write and execute permission.
- 5 (= 4 + 0 + 1) means read and execute permission, but not write permission.
- etc. 
- Note that Octal notation requires a number for each of the three user types: owner, owner's group, and all others. E.g. `$ chmod 777 myfile.txt`

### Symbolic notation

Links permissions to different symbols (i.e. abbreviations).
- Users: `u` ("User/owner"), `g` ("Group"), `o` ("Others""), `a` ("All")
- Permissions: `r` ("read"), `w` ("write"), `x` ("execute")
- Changes: `+` ("add permissions"), `-` ("remove permissions"), `=` ("set new permissions") 

---

# chmod (cont.)

Here's a quick comparison table with some common permission levels.

| Octal value | Symbolic value    | Permission level |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| 777         | a+rwx             | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 770         | u+rwx,g+rwx,o-rwx | rwxrwx---        |
| 755         | a+rwx,g=rw,o=rw   | rwxrwxrwx        |
| 700         | u+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx | rwx------        |
| 644         | u=rw,g=r,o=r      | rw-r--r--        |


--

</br> 

PS — Note the Symbolic method allows for relative changes, which means that you don't necessarily need to write out the whole entry in the table above. E.g. To go from the first line to the second line, you'd only need `$ chmod o-rwx myfile`.

---

# chown

Changing file ownership is somewhat easier than changing permissions, because you don't have to remember the different Octal and Symbolic notation mappings. 
- E.g. Say there is another user on your computer called "alice", then you could just assign her ownership of the ABC subfolder using:
 ```bash
 $ chown -R alice ABC
 ```

Things get a little more interesting when we want to add new users and groups, or change an existing users group.
- I'll save that for a later lecture on cloud servers, though.

# Things we didn't cover today

I know we covered a lot of ground today and I hope that I've given you a sense of how Bash works and how useful it can be.
- My main goal is to help "demystify" it, so that you aren't intimidated when you need to use shell commands later on.

At the same time, there's a lot that we didn't cover today.
- For loops, variables and functions, SSH, memory management (e.g. [top](https://ss64.com/bash/top.html) and [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/)), etc.
- We'll get to some of these topics in the later lectures, but please try to work some of the suggested exercises on the next slide and make use of the recommended readings.

# Next steps

### Exercises

Navigate to the `examples/` sub-directory associated with this lecture. I want you to try and play around with the contents using some of the different Bash commands we've practiced today.
- Change the permissions on an indivdual file or a whole directory.
- Read in (or fix) some lines of text from one file and pipe them to another file.
- Count the number of times Shakespeare refers to "mistress" or "love" in his Sonnets.
- Merge the separate CSVs in the "meals" subfolder into one document.
- Write a new bash script and execute it.
- Etc.
