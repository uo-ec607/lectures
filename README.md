# Data science for economists

This is a graduate economics seminar taught by [Grant McDermott](http://grantmcdermott.com) at the University of Oregon. 

Please read the [syllabus](https://github.com/uo-ec607/syllabus/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) before you go through any of the lectures. This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course. I also have some minor requests (in the "FAQ" section right at the end) if you are interested in adapting the material here for your own course.

## How do I download this material and keep up to date with any changes?

Please note that this is a work in progress, with new material being added every week. 

If you just want to read the lecture slides or HTML notebooks in your browser, then you should simply scroll down to the [Lecture outline and quicklinks](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures#lecture-outline-and-quicklinks) section below. Completed lectures will be hyperlinked (in blue) as soon as they have been added. Remember to check back in regularly to get any updates.

If you actually want to run the analysis and code on your own system (highly recommended), then you will need to download the material to your local machine. The best way to do this, while making sure that you still stay up to date with any changes, is to clone this repo via Git and then pull regularly to get updates. Please take a look at [these slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html) if you are unfamiliar with Git or are unsure how to do any of that. Once that's done, you will find each lecture contained its own a numbered folder (e.g. `01-intro`). The lectures are written in R Markdown and then exported to HMTL format. Click on the HTML files if you just want to view the slides or notebooks.
